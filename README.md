# PersonalRepository
A repository for me to put in-progress projects and old class stuff.

A lot of these are projects from various classes at the University of North Texa's Computer Science curriculum. If you are taking those classes and get a similar assignment, do not use my code. That's bad.

GitHub had issues uploading my ongoing project in Unreal Engine 4. It can be found here:
